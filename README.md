# Sky-Lantern
Developed a social networking website which manifested the symbol of sky lantern in Chinese culture, where the sky lantern stands for wishes, and thus setting off sky lanterns represents conveying messages to the sky. 
Invited by 3 start-up companies for further discussions on project feasibility.
